## Project Description
 Clothing can be used to indicate age, social standing, lifestyle, and gender in different cultures. Clothing can be used to identify people, such as "the man wearing black coat" or "the lady in the red high heels". Given the cultural relevance of clothing, the term fashion classification has numerous meanings. Predicting apparel attributes from an unlabeled photo, for example, may make it easier to find the most related fashion goods in an e-commerce database.   Similarly, classification of a consumer's favourite fashion images can be used to fuel an automated fashion stylist, who can then recommend apparel based on the user's expected style. Clothing identification in real time may be useful in surveillance situations when information about people's apparel may be utilised to identify criminal suspects. Fashion classification enables the computer-aided labelling of images with tags or descriptions related to clothes, improving the extraction of data in settings such as social media users' photos.
		
  Based on how clothing classification is used, the most critical concerns to fix may differ. We will improve fashion classification by annotating images and determining the most similar designs to an apparel item in a query image. Two sophisticated deep learning models are utilized to study, examine, and contrast fashion photograph analysis using publicly available data. It contains several rows of records with various photographs. Each row contains a unique photograph. These models undergo training using actual outcomes to provide an accurate prediction. Four strong machine learning architectures are utilized to explore, analyze, and compare fashion photo analyses using publicly available data. It contains several rows and records various photographs. Each row contains a unique photograph. These algorithms are trained using actual outcomes to provide an accurate prediction. The data set was acquired on the Kaggle platform. To execute supervised learning of architecture models, many strategies are employed. The classification of clothing pictures is calculated, quantified, and analyzed in this paper utilizing supervised CNN architecture, ANN architecture, KNN architecture and VGG19 architecture. These four models' efficacy and result-correctness are compared.
